# Finance_analysis

This project is aimed to create a __web-server__ which will automatically collect information about _requested stocks from stock exchange sites_ and analyze this data.


This automated program uses __asynchronous data processing approach__ which allows to return relevant graphs on the dynamics of costs right after requested data in CSV-format, without any additional requests from client's side. Next step is accepting estimate of the next stock price from the client. Program analyzes it using forecast accuracy metrics and returns already assessed accuracy of client forecast.


Final step is a report. Automated program makes a report on the work done and the sites found, as well as on problems in one's own work.
